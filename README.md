# old-xilinx-sdk-and-platform-studio-docs-expanded
Provides searchable access to legacy Xilinx SDK and Platform Studio documentation for quick reference - no downloads or ZIP extraction needed.

# Why?

To find documentation for older Platform Studio and SDK releases, you must manually download a ZIP file, extract it and review the contents. If you need another version, you will need to repeat this. This repo allows you to browse or check out the entire expanded directory tree to search the entire documentation library.
